  @moduledoc """
  Epistemic investigation tool — adversarial dual-prompt architecture.

  EVIDENCE QUALITY PIPELINE: Paper type classification + evidence hierarchy scoring.
  Every citation is verified against paper abstracts AND classified by type
  (systematic review, RCT, observational study, other).

  Scores come from: verification status * evidence hierarchy weight * citation bonus.
  - Systematic reviews/meta-analyses score 3x
  - RCTs/experiments score 2x
  - Observational studies score 1.5x
  - Unclassified score 1x

  PAPER-FIRST DESIGN: Runs THREE parallel paper search pairs (FOR, AGAINST, and
  SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS), then feeds merged papers to TWO adversarial LLM prompts.

  Multi-source literature search: Semantic Scholar + OpenAlex + alphaXiv.
  Uses vaos-ledger's Literature module for Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex,
  with alphaXiv MCP for embedding-based arXiv search.

  AEC TWO-STORE ARCHITECTURE (arxiv.org/abs/2602.03974):
  Evidence is classified into two stores based on source quality:
  - Grounded store: high-quality sources (major journals, high citations) — determines verdict
  - Belief store: low-quality sources (predatory journals, niche) — context only, cannot flip direction
  This prevents the homeopathy problem where niche journals outvote established science.

  ACE PATTERN (Agentic Context Engineering):
  - Helpful/Harmful counters on evidence triples in the knowledge graph
  - Compound loop fetches prior EVIDENCE, not prior conclusions
