# PLAN

**Canonical plan**: [docs/operations/roberto-content/Plan.md](docs/operations/roberto-content/Plan.md)

## Current Milestone

Remove the last family-conditioned behavior from the `investigate` core by replacing `profile`-driven grounding / verification logic with generic capability-driven cited-claim extraction, while keeping `vas-swarm-9m7` recorded as blocker evidence only.

## Active Issue

`vas-swarm-jji.3` — Replace family-specific verifier salvage with generic cited-claim extraction.
`vas-swarm-dy1` remains open as inherited repo debt. For this Roberto program, it is non-blocking unless a failing test touches `investigate` or its directly coupled planning/verification path.
Current state: `vas-swarm-jji.1` and `vas-swarm-jji.2` are complete and closed; `vas-swarm-jji.3` is now active. Repo audit shows the live boundary is `profile`-conditioned behavior, not planner/retrieval routing or a direct production call to `ClaimFamily.normalize_verification_claim/1`. `vas-swarm-9m7` stays paused as blocker evidence after three live validation attempts failed to produce a stable recurring grounded core.

## Strategic Queue

The next long-horizon tasks for the durable epistemic engine are:
- `vas-swarm-jji.1` — completed: remove `ClaimFamily` from planner selection path
- `vas-swarm-jji.2` — completed: replace family-shaped retrieval hints with generic evidence signatures
- `vas-swarm-jji.3` — active: replace profile-conditioned verifier / grounding behavior with generic capability-driven cited-claim extraction
- `vas-swarm-jji.4` — add non-paper evidence operations to the planner

Sequence:
- preserve `vas-swarm-9m7` as the blocker trace that exposed the drift
- do not add more family-specific `planetary_shape` salvage unless it is temporary debt
- continue the corrective path from `vas-swarm-jji.3`

## Verification Status

- `vas-swarm-942` is complete:
  - `mix test test/tools/investigate_test.exs` -> `100 tests, 0 failures`
  - `mix test test/investigation/evidence_planner_test.exs` -> `8 tests, 0 failures`
  - live validation carries 1 probe paper into the selected `randomized_intervention` run and produces `grounded_for_count = 1`
- `vas-swarm-tgf` is complete:
  - runtime decision telemetry is isolated off `:investigate_ledger`
  - `mix test test/intelligence/decision_ledger_test.exs test/intelligence/decision_journal_persistence_test.exs test/intelligence/runtime_ledger_isolation_test.exs test/tools/investigate_test.exs test/investigation/evidence_planner_test.exs` -> `154 tests, 0 failures`
  - four traced earth-shape wrapper runs completed without the old ledger timeout
- `vas-swarm-jji.1` is complete:
  - planner selection no longer uses `ClaimFamily`
  - `EvidencePlanner` now derives generic evidence signatures from the claim text itself
  - `mix test test/investigation/evidence_planner_test.exs test/tools/investigate_test.exs` -> `114 tests, 0 failures`
  - live validation trace [vaos-investigate-trace-783ba4fc4a18e58d-vas-swarm-jji-1-live-measurement-1775880477523.json](/var/folders/7q/tx7m0tg12m5cgq7k8z8q2dzw0000gn/T/vaos-investigate-trace-783ba4fc4a18e58d-vas-swarm-jji-1-live-measurement-1775880477523.json) selected `measurement` with generic `planning.signatures` and no family-conditioned planning metadata
- `vas-swarm-jji.2` is complete:
  - retrieval no longer uses `ClaimFamily.evidence_profile/3` in the investigate core
  - `EvidencePlanner` now builds generic retrieval profiles from operation signatures for query generation, rerank/directness scoring, and relevant-paper filtering
  - `mix test test/investigation/evidence_planner_test.exs test/tools/investigate_test.exs` -> `114 tests, 0 failures`
  - live validation trace [vaos-investigate-trace-a7be5c1d943e2844-vas-swarm-jji-2-live-curvature-1775881600133.json](/var/folders/7q/tx7m0tg12m5cgq7k8z8q2dzw0000gn/T/vaos-investigate-trace-a7be5c1d943e2844-vas-swarm-jji-2-live-curvature-1775881600133.json) selected `measurement` with generic `planning.signatures`; later citation verification degraded under provider timeout / HTTP 429 noise
- Harness audit (2026-04-11):
  - `mix test test/investigation/evidence_planner_test.exs test/investigation/claim_family_test.exs test/tools/investigate_test.exs` -> `126 tests, 0 failures`
  - `ClaimFamily.normalize_topic/1` remains live for wrapper cleanup
  - `ClaimFamily.normalize_verification_claim/1` does not appear on the production investigate path
  - the remaining meaningful family-conditioned behavior is `profile`-based branching in `investigate` / `EvidencePlanner`, which is the concrete next cut under `vas-swarm-jji.3`
- Next investigate bottleneck remains the blocker recorded by `vas-swarm-9m7`: recurring earth-shape direct-evidence papers survive selection, but verification outcomes still flip between grounded and belief across reruns
- `vas-swarm-9m7` progress before the pause:
  - claim-family / verification-claim compaction was extended for the recurring earth-shape wrappers
  - `mix test test/intelligence/decision_ledger_test.exs test/intelligence/decision_journal_persistence_test.exs test/intelligence/runtime_ledger_isolation_test.exs test/tools/investigate_test.exs test/investigation/evidence_planner_test.exs --seed 0` -> `160 tests, 0 failures`
  - blocker traces:
    - [vaos-investigate-trace-26a15ca058e69445-vas-swarm-9m7-live-3-1775866106501.json](/var/folders/7q/tx7m0tg12m5cgq7k8z8q2dzw0000gn/T/vaos-investigate-trace-26a15ca058e69445-vas-swarm-9m7-live-3-1775866106501.json): ref `8` grounded, ref `2` still belief-only
    - [vaos-investigate-trace-65d0265bdc0cbfe6-vas-swarm-9m7-live-4-1775866396092.json](/var/folders/7q/tx7m0tg12m5cgq7k8z8q2dzw0000gn/T/vaos-investigate-trace-65d0265bdc0cbfe6-vas-swarm-9m7-live-4-1775866396092.json): wrapper drifted onto unrelated black-hole horizon literature
    - [vaos-investigate-trace-b3f6795f46baf623-vas-swarm-9m7-live-5-1775866601837.json](/var/folders/7q/tx7m0tg12m5cgq7k8z8q2dzw0000gn/T/vaos-investigate-trace-b3f6795f46baf623-vas-swarm-9m7-live-5-1775866601837.json): verifier timeouts / rate limits prevented stable recurring opposing grounding
- Repo-wide inherited full-suite failures remain background debt unless the failing test intersects `investigate`, `evidence_planner`, or directly coupled verification/retrieval code

## Operating Rule

After each slice:
1. run targeted tests
2. run a live validation
3. update Beads and status docs
4. ask what Roberto would do next
5. continue if the next bottleneck is already clear
6. if three live attempts fail to verify the current milestone, mark the blocker clearly and pause instead of advancing
7. do not extend `ClaimFamily` or family-like `profile` contracts as core abstractions; either delete that logic or isolate it as explicit temporary debt
